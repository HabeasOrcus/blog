# Comprehensive Data Analysis in R

While there are plenty of resources for data science, during my studies I have found that many are lacking in content (What is the point of a blog post on data cleaning if the data is already cleaned?) or context (What are the assumptions of this test? Why not link to other resources?).  I then found myself bouncing around from Google search to textbook to blog post in order to garner the information I needed.  Here, I hope to detail the fundamentals of data analysis and statistics to build a comprehensive 'one-stop-shop' for others interested in learning data science, with the term comprehensive aimed at:

- Providing extensive examples, starting from basic to more advanced, and working through different methods of problem solving, both in approach and in coding techniques.
- Thoroughly and clearly describing the methods used to understand their assumptions, advantages, pitfalls, and common mistakes.
- Offering additional resources that have helped me in my studies and to further expand on topics.

Of course, not every possible scenario can be described and I do not claim to be an expert.  I too am regularly learning new ways to code in `R` and methods in data science (and both are constantly under development). That said, I plan for all of the posts here to be living, meaning that they will be continuously updated as I discover new information.  So, if you spot any errors, have more thorough/clear explanations or resources, if you know a better way to code, or if you have any topic requests please let me know!
