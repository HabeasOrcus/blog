# Analyzing ``CO2`` with linear regression and ANOVA

To determine which, if any, of the variables have a significant relationship with CO<sub>2</sub> uptake we can use two powerful statistical tools, linear regression and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).

Although the conc variable has 7 distinct levels, molecular concentrations are continuous and it would be sensible to model conc as a continuous variable instead of a categorical one.  

$$y_i = {\beta}_0 + {\beta}_1 x_{i,1} + {\beta}_2 x_{i,2} + ... + {\beta}_n x_{i,n} + {\epsilon}_i$$

- $y_i$ is the response variable
- $x_i$ are our predictor variables
- ${\beta}$ are coefficients for the predictor variables and the intercept
- ${\epsilon}_i$ is the error term

In our case, our equation will look like:

$$y_{i, Uptake} = {\beta}_0 + {\beta}_{Treatment} x_{i,Treatment} + {\beta}_{Type} x_{i,Type} + {\beta}_{conc} x_{i,conc} + {\epsilon}_i$$

When using categorical data to fit a linear regression model we would need to [recode the variables](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/spss/faq/coding-systems-for-categorical-variables-in-regression-analysis/) to numerical values so that they may be entered into the regression equation.  Thankfully, `R` automatically dummy codes factors when they are added to regression model, so we can go ahead and generate and analyze our model using the following code.

```{r}
CO2.lm <- lm(uptake~Type+Treatment+conc, data=CO2)

summary(CO2.lm)
```

Looking at our summary statistics we can see that the linear model has a statistically significant fit (p < 2.2e-16) with a fairly high R<sup>2</sup> (0.6839) and adjusted R<sup>2</sup> (0.6721).  From the p-values for our estimated coefficients (`Pr(>|t|)`), we can see that each of our variables are significant predictors of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake.  Therefore, we can conclude that our three predictor variables, concentration, Treatment, and Type, are significant predictors of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake.  We can then rewrite our regression equation to:

$$y_{i, Uptake} = 29.260 + 0.018 x_{i,Treatment} - 6.860 x_{i,Type} - 12.660 x_{i,conc}$$

To see how `R` coded the categorical variables we can call `$xlevels` from the `lm()` object we just created.

```{r}
CO2.lm$xlevels
```

From the output we can see that for the Type and Treatment variables "Quebec" and "nonchilled" are first followed by "Mississippi" and "chilled", respectively.  Knowing that R uses dummy coding for factors in regression we can conclude that the first levels are coded as 0 and the second as 1 for the two variables, which we can see further when we use `summary()` to see the results of our regression model.

Notice that the Type and Treatment variables are concatenated with "Mississippi" and "chilled", respectively.  When Type is "Quebec", the dummy code is 0 and therefor the value will be 0 in the regression equation ($\beta_3*x_{i,Type}=-12.659 * 0 = 0$).  Conversely, when Type is "Mississippi" which is dummy coded to 1 the value for that variable will equal the estimated coefficient ($\beta_3*x_{i,Type}=-12.659 * 1 = -12.659$).  If we happened to have a third level in Type, the value for that factor would be double the estimated coefficient, triple for a fourth level, and so forth.






```{r}
CO2.aov <- aov(CO2.lm)
```



```{r}
anova(CO2.aov)
```
